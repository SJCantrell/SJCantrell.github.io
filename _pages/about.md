Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a Dickson Instructor at the University of Chicago (and have been since September 2020).

My research interests lie in the intersection between ergodic theory and geometry. 
I use a variety of techniques from different areas of maths, including symbolic dynamics, thermodynamic formalism, analytic number theory and combinatorics 
to tackle problems coming from geometry.  The geometrical settings I consider include geometric group theory, the study of Anosov representations as well 
as flows on manifolds. I am particular interested in rigidity results (i.e. results that classify geometric structures) and counting problems. 

If you'd like to get in contact with me, you can send me an email at 's(my last name)@uchicago.edu'.
