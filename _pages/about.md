Welcome to my homepage!

My research interests lie in the intersection between ergodic theory and geometry. 
I use a variety of techniques from different areas of maths, including symbolic dynamics, thermodynamic formalism, analytic number theory and combinatorics 
to tackle problems coming from geometry.  The geometrical settings I consider include geometric group theory, the study of Anosov representations as well 
as flows on manifolds. I am particular interested in rigidity results (i.e. results that classify geometric structures) and counting problems.
