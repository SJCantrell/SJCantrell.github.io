Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a Zeeman Lecturer at the University of Warwick (and have been since September 2023).

My research interests lie in the intersection between ergodic theory and geometry. 
I use a variety of techniques from different areas of maths, including symbolic dynamics, thermodynamic formalism, analytic number theory and combinatorics to tackle problems coming from geometry.  The geometrical settings I consider include geometric group theory, the study of Anosov representations as well as flows on manifolds. I am particularly interested in rigidity results (i.e. results that classify geometric structures) and counting problems. 

If you'd like to get in contact with me, my email is stephen.(lastname)@warwick.ac.uk. Here (lastname) = cantrell.
